Computing Track Information in GPS

Last updated Jul 21, 2006.

Given the time, latitude, longitude, and elevation of each waypoint, we can compute the time and distance between each two waypoints, the elevation change, and the speed. Computing the time and elevation change is a simple matter of subtracting the values of the second waypoint from the first waypoint, and you can compute the speed by dividing the distance by the elapsed time. Computing the distance covered can become very involved because weíre not really moving in a straight line, but rather in a slight curve over the earthís surface.

The shortest distance between two points on a sphere is the great-circle distance, the computation of which is a well-known problem. The great-circle distance calculation is further complicated because the Earth isnít really a sphere, but rather a flattened spheroid. We could use the great-circle distance formula, but for the short distances weíre working with here (usually less than 300 meters) a flat earth approximation is fine.

If we use a flat earth approximation, then the distance calculation uses the Pythagorean theorem:

distance = sqrt(dlat*dlat + dlon*dlon)

Where dlat is the difference in latitudes, and dlon is the difference in longitudes. If we want to take the elevation change into account, then we just need to add the elevation difference to the calculation:

distance = sqrt(dlat*dlat + dlon*dlon + dele*dele)

The direction (course) between two points is:

course = atan2(dlon, dlat) mod (2*pi)

Putting all of that together into a C# or Visual Basic function takes a little bit more work because we have to convert the coordinates to radians, do the computation, and then convert the results to meters and degrees. The function GetCourseAndDistance shown below handles all the messy work:
[C#]

// flat earth approximation
static void GetCourseAndDistance(wptType pt1, wptType pt2, ref double course, ref double dist)
{
  // convert latitude and longitude to radians
  double lat1 = DegreesToRadians((double)pt1.lat);
  double lon1 = DegreesToRadians((double)pt1.lon);
  double lat2 = DegreesToRadians((double)pt2.lat);
  double lon2 = DegreesToRadians((double)pt2.lon);

  // compute latitude and longitude differences
  double dlat = lat2 - lat1;
  double dlon = lon2 - lon1;

  double distanceNorth = dlat;
  double distanceEast = dlon * Math.Cos(lat1);

  // compute the distance in radians
  dist = Math.Sqrt(distanceNorth * distanceNorth + distanceEast * distanceEast);

  // and convert the radians to meters
  dist = RadiansToMeters(dist);

  // add the elevation difference to the calculation
  double dele = (double)pt2.ele - (double)pt1.ele;
  dist = Math.Sqrt(dist * dist + dele * dele);

  // compute the course
  course = Math.Atan2(distanceEast, distanceNorth) % (2 * Math.PI);
  course = RadiansToDegrees(course);
  if (course < 0)
    course += 360;
}

[Visual Basic]

í flat earth approximation
Sub GetCourseAndDistance(ByVal pt1 As wptType, ByVal pt2 As wptType, ByRef course As Double, ByRef dist As Double)
  í convert latitude and longitude to radians
  Dim lat1 As Double = DegreesToRadians(CDbl(pt1.lat))
  Dim lon1 As Double = DegreesToRadians(CDbl(pt1.lon))
  Dim lat2 As Double = DegreesToRadians(CDbl(pt2.lat))
  Dim lon2 As Double = DegreesToRadians(CDbl(pt2.lon))

  í compute latitude and longitude differences
  Dim dlat As Double = lat2 - lat1
  Dim dlon As Double = lon2 - lon1

  Dim distanceNorth As Double = dlat
  Dim distanceEast As Double = dlon * Math.Cos(lat1)

  í compute the distance in radians
  dist = Math.Sqrt(distanceNorth * distanceNorth + distanceEast * distanceEast)

  í and convert the radians to meters
  dist = RadiansToMeters(dist)

  í add the elevation difference to the calculation
  Dim dele As Double = CDbl(pt2.ele - pt1.ele)
  dist = Math.Sqrt(dist * dist + dele * dele)

  í compute the course
  course = Math.Atan2(distanceEast, distanceNorth) Mod (2 * Math.PI)
  course = RadiansToDegrees(course)
  If course < 0 Then
    course += 360
  End If
End Sub

That code makes use of a few conversion functions to convert between radians, degrees, and meters. All of the trigonometric functions in the Math namespace expect their arguments to be in radians, so we have to convert the latitude and longitude values to radians. The initial distance calculation returns its result in radians that represent an arc distance that we have to convert to meters. The direction (course) calculation also is expressed in radians, which we convert to degrees. The conversion functions are:
[C#]

static double DegreesToRadians(double degrees)
{
  return degrees * Math.PI / 180.0;
}

static double RadiansToDegrees(double radians)
{
  return radians * 180.0 / Math.PI;
}

static double RadiansToNauticalMiles(double radians)
{
  // There are 60 nautical miles for each degree
  return radians * 60 * 180 / Math.PI;
}

static double RadiansToMeters(double radians)
{
  // there are 1852 meters in a nautical mile
  return 1852 * RadiansToNauticalMiles(radians);
}

[Visual Basic]

Function DegreesToRadians(ByVal degrees As Double) As Double
  Return degrees * Math.PI / 180.0
End Function

Function RadiansToDegrees(ByVal radians As Double) As Double
  Return radians * 180.0 / Math.PI
End Function

Function RadiansToNauticalMiles(ByVal radians As Double) As Double
  í There are 60 nautical miles for each degree
  Return radians * 60 * 180 / Math.PI
End Function

Function RadiansToMeters(ByVal radians As Double) As Double
  í there are 1852 meters in a nautical mile
  Return 1852 * RadiansToNauticalMiles(radians)
End Function

With a function to compute the distance between each two points, we can modify the code that outputs the track points so that it will show the course and distance, and also accumulate the distances and elevation changes so that we can calculate the total distance and elevation gain for the entire track. For bicycling, Iím especially interested in how much climbing I did, so I add up the elevation gains but donít take into account the drops in elevation. The modified OutputTrack function is shown below.
[C#]

static void OutputTrack(trkType track)
{
  Console.WriteLine("Track í{0}í", track.name);
  if (track.trkseg.Length > 0)
  {
  Console.WriteLine("{0} segments", track.trkseg.Length);
  foreach (trksegType seg in track.trkseg)
  {
    Console.WriteLine("{0} Points", seg.trkpt.Length);
    wptType wptPrev = seg.trkpt[0];
    double totalDist = 0;
    double elevationGain = 0;
    foreach (wptType wpt in seg.trkpt)
    {
    double course = 0;
    double dist = 0;
    GetCourseAndDistance(wptPrev, wpt, ref course, ref dist);
    totalDist += dist;
    if (wpt.ele > wptPrev.ele)
    {
      elevationGain += (double)(wpt.ele - wptPrev.ele);
    }
    Console.WriteLine("{0} {1} {2} {3} {4} {5}", wpt.time, wpt.lat, wpt.lon, wpt.ele, course, dist);
    wptPrev = wpt;
    }
    Console.WriteLine("Total distance = {0} kilometers. Elevation gain = {1} meters.",
    totalDist / 1000, elevationGain);
  }
  }
}

[Visual Basic]

Sub OutputTrack(ByVal track As trkType)
  Console.WriteLine("Track í{0}í", track.name)
  If track.trkseg.Length > 0 Then
    Console.WriteLine("{0} segments", track.trkseg.Length)
    Dim seg As trksegType
    For Each seg In track.trkseg
      Console.WriteLine("{0} Points", seg.trkpt.Length)
      Dim wpt As wptType
      Dim wptPrev As wptType = seg.trkpt(0)
      Dim totalDist As Double = 0
      Dim elevationGain As Double = 0
      For Each wpt In seg.trkpt
        Dim course As Double = 0
        Dim dist As Double = 0
        GetCourseAndDistance(wptPrev, wpt, course, dist)
        totalDist += dist
        If wpt.ele > wptPrev.ele Then
          elevationGain += CDbl(wpt.ele - wptPrev.ele)
        End If
        Console.WriteLine("{0} {1} {2} {3} {4} {5}", wpt.time, wpt.lat, wpt.lon, wpt.ele, course, dist)
        wptPrev = wpt
      Next
      Console.WriteLine("Total distance = {0} kilometers. Elevation gain = {1} meters.", _
          totalDist / 1000, elevationGain)
    Next
  End If
End Sub

Running that code on my DamLoop.gpx file, I get a total of 93.687 kilometers, or 58.214 miles. Thatís close enough to the 58.3 miles reported by Garmin MapSource that Iím not going to go looking for the difference.

Jim MischelCounting on side effects
    By Jim MischelMarch 12, 2008 1 Comment 

    I've long been suspicious of code that depends on side effects, like depending on the order of expression evaluation.  In the past, one had to worry about stuff like this because language standards often didn't specify expression evaluation order, which meant that code that worked when compiled with Microsoft C, for example, wouldn't work when compiled with Borland C (or vice-versa).  I wrote some code like that today in C#, and wondered if it's considered bad practice.

Jim MischelWhy no IParseable interface?
    By Jim MischelFebruary 26, 2008 No Comments 

    I found it curious that in the .NET Framework objects can implement the IFormattable interface to expose custom formatting, but there is no corresponding IParseable interface. Not only is this curious, it's somewhat frustrating. I was going to write a rant asking why the lack of IParseable and present a possible solution, and then I discovered the very good reason why such a thing hasn't been done. 

Jim MischelTake back the desktop!
    By Jim MischelFebruary 19, 2008 1 Comment 

    At some point in the 30 years or so that I've been working with computers, we've lost sight of the most important fact:  computers are supposed to be tools that serve us.  All too often these days, I feel like I'm the one serving the computer.  At other times, the computer reminds me of the over-eager employee who comes running to the office after completing every minor task, enthusiastically telling me how impressed I should be that he managed to find and actually work the photocopier.
